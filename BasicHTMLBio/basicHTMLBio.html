	<p>My name is Daniel, and I am a Web/UI Designer and Graphic Artist living in sunny Orlando, Florida. I have worked as an in-house professional for over eight years. During that time I have worked on projects ranging from UI/Web Design/Development, 3D Graphics, and 2D Graphic Design. Most recently I have utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript to develop training courseware, web applications, and webpage content. In addition to my full time work, I have had the opportunity to work on several branding projects, which consisted of logos, webpages, and supporting branding materials. I hold a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Animation from Full Sail University and three Technical Certificates in Graphic Design and Interactive/Multimedia/Web Design from Valencia College.</p>
